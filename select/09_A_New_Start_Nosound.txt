My sight is faint, my hearing is gone
It always tries to catch me off guard
But I'm glad my eyes are closed now
To not see or hear the house crumbling down
I'll come downstairs chasing your voice
And I'll find you there reading a book
The light through the windows filling the room
The shell of solitude starting to crack
I'll kiss you on the lips and our time will be back
It grew between us when I was blind by your light
It screams against me behind it's fierce eyes
It never matters how hard the strain
The beast runs towards me hungry in it's pain
Biting and scratching mistaking it's fears
Looking to escape with eyes full of tears
I'll come downstairs chasing your voice
And I'll find you there singing a song
The rain on the windows playing along
The stark inner emptiness falling apart
I'll kiss you on the lips and our time will start
