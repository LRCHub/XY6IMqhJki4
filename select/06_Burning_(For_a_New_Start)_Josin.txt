We're ashes just beholding the past, falling apart
But we wanted this bitter taste
All, all eyes on what lies upon

Slow motion, I escape your eye
In a next life, I will listen to what you say
All, all eyes on what lies upon
Will I soar towards the core?

Burning
Will I soar?
Why is it turning towards the core?
Burning
Why is it churning?
