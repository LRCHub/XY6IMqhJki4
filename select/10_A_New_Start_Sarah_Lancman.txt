Is it me you're looking for?
Will you open up the door?
I didn't realize
How my words
Could have hurt you
Will we get another chance
To fall in love at first glance?
I didn't realize
How we wasted everything
With our pride
I remember the first time that we met
I knew it was you
You took my hand
And we've landed far away on a crazy
Crazy life
My love is real for you dear
I wanna share all your smiles and all your tears
Just come close into my arms
And say darling I love you
I remember the first time that we met
I knew it was you
You took my hand
And we've landed far away on a crazy
Crazy life
My love is real for you dear
I wanna share all your smiles and all your tears
Just come close into my arms
And say darling I love you
And say darling
I love you
